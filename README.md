### Workflow for Collaboration:

Pull Changes: Before starting any new work, always pull the latest changes from the remote repository.

```sh

```

```sh
    git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```
### Add and Commit Changes:
```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

### Push Changes to Remote Repository:
